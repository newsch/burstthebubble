One of the first things a prospective student will hear about when they inevitably ask about the downsides of Olin is The Bubble, the insulating effect of this small, intimate campus and the difficulty of escaping it. Whether itâ€™s discussed in a geographical, social, or even political context, The Bubble is in reality straightforward to escape, but many students fail to do so because of a perceived lack of time, money, transportation, or interest. Raising awareness of solutions to these problems is important because The Bubble passively promotes a lack of intellectual and social diversity among Olin students, limiting their exposure to new and potentially controversial ideas, people, and experiences.
