title: "Transportation"
---
There are a variety of resources available to students looking to leave the campus, but each has its drawbacks. The most obvious and repetitive is of course the Babson-Wellesley shuttle. While this is limited to the two campuses, it is free, and can serve as a stepping stone to other means of transportation (like the shuttle between Wellesley and MIT). There are of course the GoBikes, another free source of transportation that works very well for nearby locations in fair weather, but won't get you into Boston on their own and aren't desirable in rain or snow. The nearby T stops provide transportation into Boston, but in order to use the T one has to find transportation to the station, either by walking, riding a GoBike, or getting a ride from an Uber or a friend with a car. With such a variety of options, why is the Bubble still an issue? The answer is that there is no single solution, and in rough weather or situations when timeliness is required, the only real answer is to own a car. Each option has its own caveats and downsides, raising the overall activation energy of leaving the campus to a point where it adds to the frustration and difficulty of leaving campus, further impeding the process of deciding to attend an off-campus activity. Most students deal with this at some point in order to attend something, and the key to being successful with it is to be well informed of the options available.
