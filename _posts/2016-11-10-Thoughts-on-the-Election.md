title: Thoughts on the Election

Here are some excerpts from the beginning of the thread (emphasis mine):

> ### [Therapy] I voted for Trump
>
> And I don't regret it one bit.  I never talk about the fact that I did or why I voted for him here because the Olin community is so incredibly toxic to any ideas that aren't agreed upon by the majority of the student body.  And that is why Trump won, because most people refused to event attempt understanding the other side of the aisle, instead opting to instantly label anyone who they disagreed with as racist, xenophobic, misogynistic, uneducated, childish, and incompetent.
>
> I didn't vote for Trump because I thought he'd be a good president, I know that he is an absolute shitshow.  I am a Democrat, and far to the left of most people I've met.  I voted for all of the Democratic House candidates I was able to and voted in favor of liberal ballot initiatives, but I chose to vote Trump.  You're probably either wondering "why?", thinking "this person is a fucking retard and exactly the type of person that cost Clinton this election, probably hates POC, women, and education", or "this person doesn't belong at Olin".  If your thoughts aligned with either of the last two options, I will refer you to the first paragraph of this email.

> To give some context, I voted for Trump in a state that I knew was going to be blue, so my vote was more of a message than anything else: unfair play does not deserve the presidency.  Now you might say "there was no cheating, everything was legal", "she did nothing wrong, everything was fair", or "there were only mean words sent, no plots or conspiracies".  And this is where I'd tell you to do a bit of research yourself and not just read talking points from the CNN, perhaps about Debbie Wasserman Shultz or Donna Brazile.  I refused to vote for Clinton not because I am salty about Sanders losing the nomination*, but because doing so would have told the DNC that unfair play is ok, and they can force us to elect any candidate they want if the opposition is terrible enough.  And yes, I acknowledge this is the real world and I can't always get what I want, so I should be voting for the lesser of two evils.  But in this case, Trump is a means to an end.  If there's one thing that I learned from this primary and election season, it's that the American populace is complacent.  We were complacent to let the DNC attempt to influence and manipulate the democratic process during the primaries, and as a result people who felt disenfranchised were complacent to allow Trump to beat Clinton.  But a Trump victory has given us an opportunity to start an actual political movement where people are legitimately invested in America's political environment.  It is from here, when we have a large portion of the population with very strong emotions linked to this election, that we can start to fix a broken system.  Push for the electoral colleges to be fixed, so that the actual popular vote matters.  Push for FPTP voting to be replaced.  Push for new challengers for Congressional seats to replace ineffective incumbents.  I can almost guarantee you that there will be multiple attempts at starting a progressive political party from scratch, and if we want progressivism to have a say in American politics, we WILL have to be involved with attempts at political upheaval.

> This is not the end by any means, it is the beginning of any opportunity for us to create the country we want to live in.

> \* (an interesting fact to note is that many states that cost Clinton this election, such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire, were won by Sanders in the primary, and in the predicted general election polls he was outperforming Clinton in these states as well).

A response:

> OP, I don't think you're racist, xenophobic, sexist, etc, etc, etc, on principle for voting Trump, and I really appreciate that you shared why you voted that way.  I wish I knew more people who did so.

> That said, I think you are deeply privileged and utterly unaware of it.  Voting for Trump to send a message to the DNC, and to shock the country into action, is something you can do because of privilege.  You are welcome to come back to me and say, "not I'm not privileged at all, I fit x marginalized demographics" and whatever.  Regardless of that, there is deep privilege in being able to say that  Trump presidency is best for America because you hope it will push us toward progressivism when the suffering and hatred becomes too much for most people to bear and then recognize that not everyone has that privilege

OP's response:

> Thanks for taking the time to respond.  And I will agree with you that I do have some level of privilege that is not available to everyone.  However, I tried to improve America by navigating the normal routes, voting in local elections, donating to political causes I agreed with, and it all amounted to naught.  It's difficult to push a society to change when many people can't be bothered to be involved in the change.  And I know that some people will be affected more or less by a Trump presidency than I will, but from here the most sensible course of action is to really get involved in politics while people's emotions are still raw and primed, and everyone is finally starting to realize that they'll have to actually fight for progressive causes to improve their quality of life.

> People resent the fact that I believe some amount suffering has to occur for progress to be made, and of course I can't quite argue the morality of it from my high horse while there will be those that suffer more than I will.  But we've already reached the point of no return, so there's not much else to do but fight onwards.

Another:
> To OP: If you are comfortable with your decision, you should identify yourself. Trump spoken out against Black, Muslim, Latino, disabled, and LGBT+ people, so even if no executive action is taken against them, a large proportion of the country now feels justified in openly discriminating against these groups. Additionally, the foreign policy repercussions are nearly impossible to predict, but most of our global allies are extremely pessimistic. The social policy that Obama managed to accomplish will be reversed, and this will hurt a lot of people.

> You have an "ends justify the means" attitude about this election, and you feel that your choice was rational and educated. You should identify yourself so that others can make an equally thoughtful and rational decision about how they wish to interact with you going forward. Your decision will hurt others, and you should accept responsibility for how it may hurt you too.

Another:
>I'm not OP, but is that a fucking threat?  "You're decision will hurt others, and you should accept responsibility for how it may hurt you too???"  What the fuck??  I'd be afraid to say anything conservative on this campus for fear of getting fucking verbally abused for having a view different than the Olin student body majority.

> I'm sorry, but wake up Olin!  We're so liberal, which isn't a bad thing.  However, I think it's so hypocritical to freak out at people for having different views and treat them extremists.  You are inherently becoming extreme yourselves.

> Take a nice long look at yourselves.  You're throwing stones and you live in a glass house.

Another:
> A clear example is when a couple of weeks ago when the Honor Board put up those whiteboards asking what people felt they could not share at Olin.  One individual wrote that they could not support Trump without fear of instantly being attacked (verbally I assume), and by the time the whiteboards were filled there were a multitude of responses trying to tell that person why they were wrong for even considering voting for Trump.  This was on a public whiteboard that had the intention of CREATING SAFE SPACES, for people to express the beliefs.  All this shows is that many Oliners only think that the beliefs they agree with should be expressed, and all others can just be ignored or attacked

Another:
> So this has all been very vague. What are the conservative views that you/others hold and think other Oliners will hate you for? Why do you hold
> these views?

Another:
> I'm pro-life. HRC wasn't going to curb abortion, a Donald presidency +
Republican Congress + conservative supreme court might.

> Note that I'm not saying "defund planned parenthood" or "I hate women" or
even "abortion should be illegal and criminalized." Just "fetuses are
people and you shouldn't intentionally end their lives."

> Also note that I personally DID vote for her. There was too much other
problems with Trump for me to go for it. But a lot of people are
single-issue voters. And pro-lifers definitely exist at Olin.

Another:

> Bullshit.

> There was literally a box to put your answers into if you didn't want to
respond. That person chose to put their idea up in public. The board was
not marked "THIS IS A SAFE SPACE, DO NOT RESPOND" or anything even
approaching that, so if that was the Honor Board's intent, they didn't
communicate it successfully.

> If you want to put your ideas out in public, you must be prepared to allow
people to respond in the same manner. Period. If you want whiteboards where
Oliners can write whatever hateful things they want anonymously and no one
can respond, too bad.

> "...many Oliners only think that the beliefs they agree with should be
expressed, and all others can be ignored or attacked."

> No. Many Oliners believe that all opinions may be expressed, but then may
also be challenged. Some ideas get challenged more often than others in
this environment. I wonder why an idea might be challenged a lot?

Another:
> A great debate hosted by NPR that outlines concepts of free speech and also extreme leftism on college campuses. It is worth 1 hour to listen to it.

Another:
> Not OP either, but someone with some views contrary to the most advocated ones on campus:

> There are plenty of specific issues that have a very one sided presence on campus, like energy security vs environmental concerns, firearms and the second amendment vs safety and feelings, or things like the government issuing marriage licenses at all, let alone to partners that won't produce children, which is the goal of marriage tax break incentives. In general, the idea that people fundamentally aren't all equal, and that people should be given equal opportunities, not opportunities till they are equal across all axes.

> As a concrete example, I support the DAPL, and while I would love to have discussions on both all the positive and negative aspects (There sure are a lot of both), I don't think I could have that openly on campus without lashback or people labeling me with a lot of connotative and pejorative words. As such, I haven't voiced that at all.
